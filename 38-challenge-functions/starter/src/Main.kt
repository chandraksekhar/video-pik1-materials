fun main() {
  /*
  * Challenge 1:
  *
  * Create a function which takes in two parameters - a name and a last name. Because not everyone has a last name,
  * leave the lastName parameter to be an empty String if it is not passed in.
  *
  * Then return how long the person's full name is.
  */

  /*
  * Challenge 2:
  *
  * Overload the function from the first challenge, by adding a list of Strings parameter, for middle names,
  * in case someone has one or more middle names.
  *
  * Use the function to return the full name length, for a name with and without middle names.
  * Remember to use named arguments if needed.
